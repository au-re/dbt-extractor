### The grammar

- See `grammar.js`
- most of the files in this folder are generated by tree-sitter
- the `grammar.js` file is probably the only file you need to look at or edit
  (besides tests)

### Developing this grammar

**Prerequisites**
```
npm install
```

**Running the parser**

```
# Generate the parser
tree-sitter generate

# Test parsing a file
tree-sitter parse example-file

# Test parsing a file with extended output
tree-sitter parse example-file -d

# Test parsing a file with HTML state-machine output
tree-sitter parse example-file -D

# Run the test suite
tree-sitter test
```

See the `scripts/` directory for helper scripts for running the test suite.

**Aliases**

Consider adding the following to your bashrc (or similar):

```
export PATH=$PATH:./node_modules/.bin
```

The `tree-sitter` binary lives in the `node_modules/.bin` directory, so if you
choose not to do this, then you can prefix all of the `tree-sitter` commands
above with `./node_modules/.bin/tree-sitter`.
